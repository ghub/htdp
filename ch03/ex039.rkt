; Exercise 39.
; Good programmers ensure that an image such as CAR can be enlarged or reduced
; via a single change to a constant definition. Good programmers establish a
; single point of control for all aspects of their programs, not just the
; graphical constants. Several chapters deal with this issue. We started the
; development of our car image with a single plain definition:

; (define WHEEL-RADIUS 5)

; The definition of WHEEL-DISTANCE is based on the wheelâ€™s radius. Hence,
; changing WHEEL-RADIUS from 5 to 10 doubles the size of the car image. This
; kind of program organization is dubbed single point of control, and good
; design employs this idea as much as possible.

; Develop your favorite image of an automobile so that WHEEL-RADIUS remains the
; single point of control.
