You are a programmer now
    Programs are for other people to read.
    Programs reflects the problems statements and its important concepts.
    Programs comes with a concise self-description.
    Good programming is about solving problems systematically and conveying the system within the code.


Fixed-Size Data
===============

    Programming language
        Language of data
        Language of operations on data

1 Arithmatic

    It is critical for a programmer to know how the chosen language calculates.

    Atomic data of BSL
        Numbers
        Strings
        Images
        Boolean values

    Primitive operations or pre-defined operations

1.1 The Arithmatic of Numbers

    Prefix notation

    Numbers
        Natural numbers
        Integers
        Rational numbers
        Real numbers
        Complex numbers

    Precision of numbers
        Exact numbers
        Inexact numbers: #i prefix

1.2 The Arithmatic of Strings

    1String
    string-append

1.3 Mixing It Up

    string-length
    string-ith
    number->string
    substring

1.4 The Arithmatic of Images

    Primitive operations
        Creation
            line
            circle
            ellipse
            triangle
            rectangle
            text
        Properties
            image-width
            image-height
        Composition (need to understand anchor point)
            overlay
            overlay/xy
            overlay/align
            empty-scene
            place-image
            scene+line

1.5 The Arithmatic of Booleans

    Booleans
        #true
        #false

    Operations
        or
        and
        not

1.6 Mixing It Up with Booleans

    Conditionals
        if

    =
    <
    <=
    >
    >=

    string=?
    string<=?
    string>=?

1.7 Predicates: Know Thy Data

    Predicates

    number?
    string?
    image?
    boolean?

    integer?
    rational?
    real?
    complex?

    exact?
    inexact?

2 Functions and Programs

    Arithmatic
    Algebra
        Variable
        Function definition
        Function application
        Function composition

2.1 Functions

    Program
        Definitions
            Constant definitions
                (define Variable Expression)
            Function definitions
                (define (FunctionName Variable ... Variale)
                    Expression)
                Inputs (function header, arguments or parameters)
                    unary
                    binary
                    ternary
                Outputs (function body)

2.2 Computing

    Function application
        Determine the values of argument expressions.
        Check that the number of arguments and number of function
            parameters are the same.
        Computes the value of the body of the function, with all
            parameters replaced by the corresponding argument values.

2.3 Composing Functions

    Composition
        main definition or function
        auxiliary or helper functions

    Define one function per task.

2.4 Global Constants

    Global constant
        Global variable (name)
        Constant definition (right hand side)
            Literal constant
            Computed constant

    For every constant mentioned in a problem statement,
        introduce one constant definition.

2.5 Programs

    From a coding perspective
        Functions
            Main function composes other functions
        Constant definitions

    From the perspective of launching a program
        Batch program
            consumes all of its inputs and computes its results
        Interactive program (event driven)
            Iterate
                consumes some inputs (events and event handlers)
                compute
                produces some output

    Batch programs
        2htdp/batch-io
            read-file
            write-file
            'stdin
            'stdout

    Interactive programs
        2htdp/universe
            big-bang

            (big-bang cw0
              [on-tick tock]
              [on-key ke-h]
              [on-mouse me-h]
              [to-draw render]
              [stop-when end?]
              ...)
