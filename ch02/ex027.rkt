; Exercise 27.
; Our solution to the sample problem contains several constants in the middle
; of functions. As One Program, Many Definitions already points out, it is best
; to give names to such constants so that future readers understand where these
; numbers come from. Collect all definitions in DrRacketâ€™s definitions area and
; change them so that all magic numbers are refactored into constant
; definitions.
